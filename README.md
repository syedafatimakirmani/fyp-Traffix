# 🚗 Decentralized Vehicle Violation & Document Control System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **blockchain-powered application** that manages:  
- Vehicle violations (traffic fines, penalties, etc.)  
- Secure storage & verification of vehicle and driver documents  

The system leverages **decentralization** to provide:  
- 🔒 Security – Cryptographic verification of records  
- 📝 Transparency – Immutable record of violations & documents  
- ⚡ Efficiency – Faster verification for authorities & citizens  
- ✅ Trust – Eliminates manipulation & corruption

## 🛠️ Features  
- Decentralized storage of vehicle documents (license, registration, vehicle copy)  
- Blockchain-based violation recording  
- Role-based access (citizens, traffic police)  
- Real-time document verification  
- Smart contracts for fine payments  
- Tamper-proof digital records

## 🏗️ Architecture  
1. **Frontend** – User interface (React )  
2. **Backend** – Solidity 
3. **Blockchain Layer** – Smart contracts (Solidity on Ethereum)  
4. **Storage** – IPFS for decentralized document storage  (Pinata )
5. **Authentication** – Web3 wallet login (e.g., MetaMask)
